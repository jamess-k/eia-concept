  <h3> Our Program's History</h3>
  <p> English in Action is a relatively new program at Cornell University in particular, however we have existed as a
    national organization since 1994, when we were initially created at the Roaring Fork Valley in Colorado by the
    Basalt Regional Library to help out a large influx of immigrant workers who did not speak English. Back then, we
    were called the Adult Literacy Program and only operated on a small scale of a few dozen members at the time, each
    focused on one on one tutoring groups to help bridge the differences in language and culture between members of the
    community.</p>

  <p> In 2005 the modern day English in Action was born due to a necessity to move out of the small library as we grew
    in size. Founder Julie Fox-Rubin took the new program under her wing and spread it further beyond a single brick and
    mortar building to eventually become the large entity it is today. Since 2008, English in Action has operated as an
    independent nonprofit organization when our current director, Lara Beaulieu, was onboarded. In the modern day, we
    are headquarted in El Jebel however our online presence extends across the country where we now found our presence
    at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.</p>

        <!-- Source: https://englishinaction.org/success-stories/ -->
        <p>Matched December 2015 -- Aaron and Elmer meet weekly and spend their entire hour together in conversation. Elmer welcomes the practice, and feels it is helping him to connect more with his children, who often prefer to speak English. It is also helping him advance at work and speak to his customers. Aaron loves the opportunity to connect in a positive way with a fellow community member. He says: “I truly hope that the friendship Elmer and I have formed will help me to build a rapport with every person I meet and in turn they will trust I will do the right things for the right reasons.” Elmer came to the valley in 1992 from El Salvador. Aaron lives in Glenwood Springs and is a police sergeant in Basalt.</p>

        <p>Matched January 2017 -- “John is like a son to me,” says David. For his part, John considers David to be his
          closest friend in the United States. The pair participates in many English In Action activities together, and
          frequently socialize outside of their classes. Since being matched with David, John’s English skills have
          improved dramatically, and now he is speaking at an upper intermediate level. John and his wife Paulina share
          dinner almost weekly with David to work on David’s Spanish. John has also branched out in his life, joining
          English In Action’s student leadership group, as well as opening his own business. John moved to the valley
          from Colombia in 2016. David—a former art gallery owner—has lived locally for over 30 years.</p>

        English. Gaye writes, “I look forward to seeing Esperanza each week and am proud of her accomplishments. Sometimes our best lessons are the days when we just sit and talk.” Esperanza tells us that she deeply appreciates the opportunity to have a friend in the English-speaking community. All of their hard work has
          paid off recently when Esperanza eared her GED diploma. Gaye is a Basalt resident. Esperanza moved to the U.S.

        <p>Matched January 2015 -- After more than a decade with English in Action, Beatriz is now a proficient English
          speaker and has become a vibrant member of the community. When Janet & Beatriz began their partnership in
          2015, Beatriz spoke in a soft voice that was difficult to hear. Now she is speaking with more confidence and
          has even spoken to large groups in English. Now a Match Advisor on English In Action’s staff, she also chairs
          English In Action’s student leadership group where her steady and calm guidance has been invaluable.
          Originally from El Salvador, Beatriz moved to the valley in 2006. Prior to her death in December 2021, Janet
          lived in Woody Creek for more than 50 years and tutored nine students during her tenure as a volunteer. We are

        <p>Matched March 2015 -- In their three years together Jesse and Chris were relaxed and comfortable with each
          other. The pair made a point to celebrate Jesse’s learning milestones and studied for his citizenship exam.
          Chris admired Jesse’s dedication to learning a difficult new language and his drive to improve his quality of
          life. In their lessons, Chris noted, “perfection isn’t the goal,” and they both embraced mistakes with
          laughter and compassion. Mistakes or no, Jesse’s scores improve with every evaluation. Originally from Peru,
          Jesse moved to the valley in 2003. Chris was a beloved teacher at Aspen Community School and lived in
          Carbondale until his death in 2018. He was a dynamic and dear member of our community, and we are grateful for

        <!-- Source: https://englishinaction.org/success-stories/ -->
        <p>Matched in October 2017 -- Shinta, an engineer by trade, immigrated to the United States from Indonesia with
          limited English language skills. Her inability to communicate made her feel isolated and powerless. While
          studying with her first tutor nearly ten years ago, Shinta gradually learned English. Now, her skills are such
          that she excels in her position as English In Action’s Office Manager. Her diligence and attention to detail
          make her an essential member of staff. Shinta continues her education with her tutor, Julie, with whom she
          studies advanced writing and professional English. In November 2017, Shinta bravely shared her story with a
          sold-out crowd at English In Action’s Immigrant Voices event. Shinta has lived here with her family since
          2006. Julie resides in Basalt and is a freelance writer.</p>

          dedicated herself to supporting her kids and working as a housekeeper. When Estela started studying with Polly
          she only had survival English, and while she has worked hard at improving her English, it has proved
          unrealistic to return to her profession in the U.S. Estela was undeterred and she has now launched a new
          career as a personal trainer. Estella is a dedicated community volunteer, helping out in her children’s
          schools, at church and with Aspen Sante Fe Ballet. She is an integral part of English In Action’s Student
          Leadership Committee and now has become a volunteer tutor. Polly is a longtime resident of the Valley and has
          been a tutor for English In Action since 1995.</p>

        <p>Matched July 2014 -- Rosa was a cosmetologist and salon owner in her native Guatemala prior to moving to the
          United States in 2007. Before connecting with her tutor Angye, Rosa was unsure of herself in her new home and
          struggled to communicate in English. With Angye’s help, Rosa is now more willing to take risks in English and
          has the confidence to pursue her goals. After passing the exam in English, Rosa earned her Colorado
          cosmetology license in 2016 and has owned and operated the Main Street Barber Shoppe in Carbondale since 2017.
          An engaged community member, Rosa also serves on English In Action’s Student Leadership Committee and Board of
          Directors. While Angye now calls Detroit home, the pair maintains their close friendship via social media. Of
          Rosa’s pending citizenship application, Angye has told to her, “When you do get your citizenship, I will be
          there no matter what!”</p>

        April of 2017, she became a US citizen with the help of her last English In Action tutor. She was then matched
