# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - We all commit to putting in our best work with the goal of creating the best website for our client.
    - We have the goal of creating and interactive website that mets our client's needs with strong and functional design.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - We will listen to each other's ideas without interrupting and take them all into consideration.
    - We will collaborate, but not change other people's work without permission.
    - We will communicate our changes through descriptive commit messages and in the group chat.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will communicate through our groupchat whenever significant changes are made on the project. We will try to meet in person weekly after section to create a plan for the following milestone.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We have received the phone number of our client and plan to create a group chat with her and the project group, so that everyone can be involved in the process of meeting and collaborating with our client. We will set up in-person or Zoom meetings with our clients ideally on a weekly basis before the deadline of our next milestone.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    James plans on taking the responability of reaching out the client to schedule meetings and interviews. This will take place in a group chat with everyone involved, but he will take the initiative in sending the texts and making the plans.

    Jackson will be responsable for taking notes during the interviews with our client. All of us will help in taking notes and being present, but Jackson will be the main one translating these notes into VS code.

    Adler will take the responsability of setting meeting times for the group members and making sure that we avoid merge conflicts when working together.

    Mateo will be in charge of filling out the submission form for the various milestones throughout the course of this project.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    First, we will have constant communication in our group chat about project activities. We will also use our detailed commit messages to keep each other accountable for the work each person has done. We know that, even though we have set roles within the team, our roles are fluid and we shoiuld be able to cover another team member with any work needed to be done. If a team member appears to not be contributing equally we will warn him and say that, if this keeps on going, we will have to let the professor about their inabiloity to contribute to the project. For a team member who fails to deliver what was promised, we will give them an accelerated warning, let out TA know about their inability to complete their job, and tell them that if it happens again the professor will be notified about the situation.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    We will review the team contract as a team and give our opinion and the conflict/s we have encountered. We will then decide, as a team, what the best course of action is and how we should resolve or penalize the conflict so that it does not happen again. Any and all conflict regarding the project team will be resolved *as a team*.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    Any time we encounter a conflict, we should re-visit the contract and make any necessary changes. Reading the contract is a good reminder of what we should remeber when going forward with our group project, and will help make the team function more effectively.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    Our group will try to meet in places on campus like Temple of Zeus or the Dairy Bar where we can take breaks to get coffee or ice cream and hang out in an informal setting for a little while.

A commitment of promise that each group member will not over work or underwork as compared to other group members. And that if they do one of these things, they are responsible for the negative impact to our grade that may ensue.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
